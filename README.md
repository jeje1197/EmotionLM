# EmotionLM
A library for integrating episodic memory within AI applications. It is driven by a multi-dimensional retrieval system through uses the Affective Link Score (ALS) and Context Path Traversal.

## Core Results
Accuracy: 26.6% improvement over uninformed baseline in Task 1 (Memory Connection Prediction).

Primary Driver: Temporal proximity ($w_T = 3.1470$) identified as the lead factor for episodic coherence.

IP Protection: Subject to U.S. Provisional Patent No. 63/949,166.

## Methodology
ALS integrates semantic similarity, emotional similarity, and temporal proximity to move beyond a standard 1D top-$k$ search.
